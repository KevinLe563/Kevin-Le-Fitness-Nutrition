      <strong>MEET KEVIN</strong>
      <br />
      <br />

      and fitness world. Since starting weight training in the summer of 2018,
      Kevin has grown his passion for both fitness and nutrition. He is working
      on balacing his focus on weightlifting and maintaining a healthy diet with
      his current studies at the University of Waterloo.

      <br />
      <p>
        Over the course of his lifting career, Kevin has tried a full-body
        routine 3 times a week, a 2-day split (deadlift and bench on day 1,
        squat on day 2) and a 3-day split (push pull legs). Currently, Kevin is
        running the 3-day split comprising of both upper and lower body designed
        towards both strength and muscle hypertrophy. More details on Kevin's
        split is on the workout page. Cardio is integrated on off-days and
        through sports.
